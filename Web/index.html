          <p>
            As a reflection of the whole family of God, Members, who are known as Vincentians, are drawn from every ethnic and cultural background, age group, and economic level. Vincentians are
            united in an international society of charity by their spirit of poverty, humility and sharing, which is nourised by prayer and reflection,
            mutually supportive gatherings, and adherence to basic Rule.
          </p>

          <p>
            Organized locally, Vincentians witness God's love by embracing all works of charity and justice. The Society
            collaborates with other people of good will in reliving need and addressing its causes, making no distinction in those served because,
            in them Vincentians see the face of Christ.
